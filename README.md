# RBAC


<hr>
### Design
- Everyone has Guest permissions
- Anyone logged in has Registered Shopper permissions
- The superadmin page assumes that there will not be many
  Super Administrators working concurrently and they will work with care.
  Thus caching is appropriate.


<hr>
### To Do
- Functionality: Command table with add/remove
- Functionality: AccessGroup table with add/remove
- Functionality: Auth and auth API
- Figure out commands and integration


<hr>
### Done
- Add/remove Users/Shoppers from AccessGroups


<hr>
### Known Bugs
- None (uh oh)
